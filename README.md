# Idea
Trying to write an application based on protobuff communication. 
The main idea is there will be two microservices written in 
- python
- nodejs or golang

A common protobuff data structure will be shared among them. They will use that proto libs to comminucate between them using http protocol.

# Folder structure

# Commands
## proto lib generate
## python project run 
- go to python project directory `cd python-service`
- setup virtual environment `virtualenv venv` (first time only)
- source it `source venv/bin/activate`
- install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- to run the basic flask app run `export FLASK_APP=main.py` and `python -m flask run`

Boom! Serveer is running in `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` :) 

## nodejs or golang project run
