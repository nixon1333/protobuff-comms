# Idea
Trying to write an application based on protobuff communication. 
The main idea is there will be two microservices written in 
- python
- nodejs or golang

A common protobuff data structure will be shared among them. They will use that proto libs to comminucate between them using http protocol.

# Folder structure

# Commands
## proto lib generate
## python project run 
## nodejs or golang project run
